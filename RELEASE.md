## Notes

**KNOWN ISSUES**
- [ ] Test with travelling fire curve `travelling_fire` in `sfeprapy.func.temperature_fires`
- [ ] Graphical user interface, with multiprocessing capability
- [ ] Make validation procedures
- [ ] Make verification procedures
- [ ] Upgrade `sfeprapy.time_equivalence_core.mc_inputs_generator2` with `scipy.stats.norm.ppf` and `scipy.stats.gumbel_r.ppf` to generate Monte Carlo input samples.
- [ ] Add array input variable feature which input files will be automatically populated based on variables arrays.
- [ ] Additional argument `is_distplot_naked` for distribution variable data visulisation.
- [ ] Generate report about generated random variables, i.e. to calculate miu and sigma and compare with input values.

**15/08/2018 VERSION 0.0.2**
- Graphical folder select dialog is available to select folders;
- Fixed an issue associated with `sfeprapy.time_equivalence.run()` where would not ask for new input folder directory when run more than once without re-import the module;
- Fixed window opening fraction factor distribution. Previously the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ are adopted based on $x$, however, the `scipy.stats.lognorm` module takes $\mu$ and $\sigma$ based on $ln(x)$. This has been corrected;

**04/08/2018 VERSION: 0.0.1**
- Renamed the packaged from `sfepy` to `sfeprapy` (Structural Fire Engineering Probabilistic Risk Assessment Python);
- Github repository created;
- Updated progress bar appearance in `sfeprapy.time_equivalence.run()`;
- Implemented new window opening fraction distribution `window_open_fraction`, linear distribution is now replaced by inverse truncated log normal distribution;
- Updated plot appearance; and
- Project now can be installed through `pip install sfeprapy`.

**02/01/2018 VERSION: 0.0.0**
- Implemented Latin hypercube sampling function, `pyDOE` external library is no longer required;
- Boundary for `q_fd`, defined as `q_fd_ubound` and `q_fd_lbound` (upper and lower limit). DEPRECIATED;
- Now output plot for peak steel temperature according to input 'protection_thickness';
- Inputs arguments are packed in a pandas `DataFrame` object instead of a list;
- Automatically generate fires inline with selected percentile `select_fires_teq` Â±tolerance `select_fires_teq_tol` and save as .png and .csv.
