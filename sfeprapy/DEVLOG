* Write model technical description manual
* Produce report for each work directory
* Package all trivial outputs for each work file

04/08/2018 VERSION: 0.0.1 (alpha)
- Re-grouped files and made the code avaliable as a Python package;
- Renamed the packaged from 'sfepy' to 'sfeprapy' (i.e. fire safety eng. prob. risk assessment python);
- Github repository now created;
- Code published on PyPI.

02/01/2018 VERSION: 0.0.0 (pre-alpha)
- Implemented latin hypercube sampling function, pyDOE external library is nolonger required;
- Boundary for q_fd, defined as q_fd_ubound and q_fd_lbound (upper and lower limit);
- Now output plot for peak steel temperature according to input 'protection_thickness';
- Inputs arguments are packed in a pandas DataFrame object instead of a list;
- Automatically generate fires that satisfies selected percentile Â±tolerance and save as .png and .csv.
- This script, Structural Reliability Probabilistic Analysis (SPRA), utilises Monte Carlo simulation method (i.e. one as
  specified within PD 7974-7). Latin hypercube sampling technique is used for obtaining randomly generated probabilistic
  parameters.
